#================================ HTTP Endpoint ======================================
# Each beat can expose internal metrics through a HTTP endpoint. For security
# reasons the endpoint is disabled by default. This feature is currently experimental.
# Stats can be access through http://localhost:5066/stats . For pretty JSON output
# append ?pretty to the URL.

# Defines if the HTTP endpoint is enabled.
#http.enabled: false

# The HTTP endpoint will bind to this hostname, IP address, unix socket or named pipe.
# When using IP addresses, it is recommended to only use localhost.
#http.host: localhost

# Port on which the HTTP endpoint will bind. Default is 5066.
#http.port: 5066

# Define which user should be owning the named pipe.
#http.named_pipe.user:

# Define which the permissions that should be applied to the named pipe, use the Security
# Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL) to define the permission. This option cannot be used with
# `http.user`.
#http.named_pipe.security_descriptor:

#============================= Process Security ================================

# Enable or disable seccomp system call filtering on Linux. Default is enabled.
#seccomp.enabled: true

#================================= Migration ==================================

# This allows to enable 6.7 migration aliases
#migration.6_to_7.enabled: false
